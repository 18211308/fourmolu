PLEASE READ: Fourmolu is a fork of Ormolu, and will be continually merging in Ormolu development work. If your feature request can be implemented in Ormolu as a general improvement, please make an issue there: https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues.

If your formatting issues arise due to Fourmolu's options (e.g. formatting that looks weird with 4-space indentation, which Ormolu doesn't care about), go ahead and fill out this ticket.
