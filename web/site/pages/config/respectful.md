When enabled, Fourmolu will avoid changing line breaks from how the user inputted them. It's best to just look at the test files to see the difference:

* [General tests](https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu/tree/main/data/fourmolu/respectful)
* [Respectful with module where](https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu/tree/main/data/fourmolu/respectful-module-where)
